# bubbles.css but better

honestly i really like the bubbles.css file that Blade04208 created, and i use it religiously all the time, but i kinda felt like making a few adjustments to it because idk i'm just a crybaby who wants everything perfect  
i made the bubbles a bit taller, changed embeds so they actually adhere to proper margins, and created a left-aligned variant for the people that prefer that
